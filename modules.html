            <li>Covered basics like SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, constraints, normalization, and data integrity.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Algorithmic Problem Solving</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Focused on building logic and problem-solving skills using algorithms and programming.</li>
            <li>Likely included searching, sorting, recursion, and basic computational thinking.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>System Design</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Introduced you to designing software systems using UML, use cases, and software architecture principles.</li>
            <li>May have involved analysis of requirements and planning software development life cycles.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Object-Oriented Programming (Java)</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Taught you the principles of OOP using Java: classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.</li>
            <li>Included building applications with good software structure.</li>
        </ul>
        
    </ol>
    <h2> Second Year Modules :</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>C# Web Apps and Services</li>

            <li>Focused on ASP.NET Core and building modern web apps and APIs using C#.</li>
            <li>You’ve worked on projects involving controllers, Razor Pages, services, and design patterns.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Relational and NoSQL Databases</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Extended your knowledge of databases by comparing relational (e.g. PostgreSQL, Supabase) and NoSQL (e.g. MongoDB). </li>
            <li>Hands-on experience with real-world data modeling and integration in projects.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Enterprise Project</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed a full-stack healthcare application called Health Care Link, using C#, Blazor Pages, and Supabase (PostgreSQL).</li>
            <li>The app supports user management, role-based access (patients, doctors, trustees), appointment scheduling, and prescription handling.</li>
            <li>Applied MVC architecture, modular design, and cloud database integration.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>AI Project – Maze Solver</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Created a Python application to solve mazes using BFS (Breadth-First Search), DFS (Depth-First Search), and A* search algorithms.</li>
            <li>Compared the performance and pathfinding efficiency of these algorithms.</li>
            <li>Used Pyamaze for visualizing the maze and agent navigation.</li>
