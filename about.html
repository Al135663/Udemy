    <h1>Work Experience</h1>
    <h2>2004-2021</h2>
    <p>During my apprenticeship, I was responsible for writing and editing CNC programs from scratch using the Heidenhain control system to produce precision-engineered components. I regularly created and adjusted programs to meet technical specifications and improve machining efficiency. I also used AutoCAD (2D and 3D) to interpret technical drawings and assist in the design and setup of parts for manufacturing.</p>
    <p>During my time in this role, I produced high-precision components for aerospace companies such as Airbus, as well as parts for oil and gas companies both within the UK and internationally. This experience gave me a strong understanding of industry standards, tight tolerances, and the importance of quality control in high-stakes environments.</p>
